<strong>These paintings hold a special place in my heart as they mark my artistic beginnings. Each piece took an average of 5 hours to create, but time seemed to fade away as I immersed myself in the joy of the process. The satisfaction I felt upon completing each artwork was incredibly rewarding and motivates me to continue exploring my passion for painting.</strong></p>
